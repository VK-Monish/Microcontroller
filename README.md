# Microcontroller Projects ‚Äì PIC16F877A

This repository showcases a collection of embedded C projects built for the **PIC16F877A** microcontroller. Each project demonstrates interfacing with basic electronic components such as LEDs, 7-segment displays, push buttons, and timers.

## üß† Overview

The goal of this repository is to:

- Provide practical examples for beginners learning embedded systems using PIC microcontrollers.
- Demonstrate core concepts like digital I/O, timer configuration, and display control.
- Offer a platform for exploring project-based learning in embedded C.

## üîß Microcontroller Used

- **PIC16F877A**
  - 40-pin DIP
  - 8-bit architecture
  - Built-in Timers, ADC, I/O Ports, USART, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Requirements

- **Compiler:** MPLAB X IDE with XC8 Compiler
- **Programmer:** PICkit 3 / PICkit 4 or equivalent
- **Simulation (Optional):** Proteus for circuit simulation

## üîÑ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VK-Monish/Microcontroller.git

    Open the .c files inside MPLAB X IDE.

    Compile and flash the code using your programmer (e.g., PICkit 3).

    Test on breadboard or simulate using Proteus.

üì∏ Example Applications

    Countdown timer using TIMER_0

    Digital stopwatch with 2 buttons (start/stop & reset)

    Running characters on an 8x8 LED matrix

    Digit display on 7-segment using BCD encoding
